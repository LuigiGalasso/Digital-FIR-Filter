This folder contains 3 subfolders,respectively: vhdl(for simulations), syn(for synthesis) and netlist(containing some generated netlist). The files identified with myfir name are the main modules in each implementation, whereas the simulation's results and synthesis reports are identified by specific names. In the folder vhdl/simulation the file script.tcl is exploited for simulations through modelsim, while in the folder syn two scripts are present, i.e. script.scr(for the logic synthesis and some reports generations) and power.scr(specific for the power reports). Similar scripts for the simulation post synthesis are present in the subfolder simulation of the respective syn and innovus folders.
